        So you're learning Hiragana. You want to practice writing after hearing
        or seeing the character. This tool helps you do just that. Just select
        which row you want to practice (you can select multiple rows if you
        like). Then click on the "Surprise Me" button to get a random character.
        Click on the character to hear it again. Click on the "Help Me" button
        to see the character. Click on the "Done" button to move on to the next
        character.
